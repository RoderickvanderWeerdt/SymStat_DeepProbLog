# DeepProbLog
Most of the code here is taken from: https://bitbucket.org/problog/deepproblog/src/master/.

We added an extra experiment of solving sudoku puzzles to show the possibilities of DeepProbLog.

The creators wrote DeepProbLog as an extension of [ProbLog](https://dtai.cs.kuleuven.be/problog/) that integrates Probabilistic Logic Programming with Deep Learning. This is their [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.10872) on DeepProbLog.
