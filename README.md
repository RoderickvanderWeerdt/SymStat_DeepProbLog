# Addition beyond Addition: On sudoku puzzles and DeepProbLog

This repository is a built upon and copied from: https://bitbucket.org/problog/deepproblog/src/master/.

The creators wrote DeepProbLog as an extension of [ProbLog](https://dtai.cs.kuleuven.be/problog/) that integrates Probabilistic Logic Programming with Deep Learning. This is their [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.10872) on DeepProbLog. 

To further investigate the possibilities of DeepProbLog we added an experiment in which the program had to solve sudoku puzzles with handwritten symbols.

### Running the code
With all the files pulled it should be as simple as:

python run.py


To create filled sudokus:
